# Intro
Open Source creates a big conflict of interest with commercial endeavors. I do not feel it is being used as it should be used or it was meant to be used. From a business point of view, they are not necessarily looking for free things; most businesses I've worked with don't mind purchasing software licenses and paying for services.

Even if the service is not great, they just wont hire you again.

If the service is great, they will continue to hire you if they have a need. So the current open source philosophy is in contrast to this.

I see open source working for business long term in a few manners:

1) As a place for schools to search for public domain code samples. This has worked well for the literature industry and schools.

2) As a place for open review of internet infrastructure that is publicly funded. This works well for city roads, highways, tunnels bridges and sewers. However, inspection is not normally allowed by unqualified professionals. Although auditing of costs is more lenient.

First thing I noticed is Mercedez-Benz is sponsoring Open SSL and Curl. I'm wondering if a better model is for these two organizations to form a non profit or llc with professional ethics charter and receive money directly from taxes or through a public audit donation system. They would itemize their payroll and overhead needs for the public (leases, rents, servers etc). It would be similar to having a 990 form which would be viewable on charity navigator and guidestar.

Going forward, open source needs better accounting for programmer time once the reach a professional level and a way for the programmer to sell or license their code to a professional organization that can make money off it and pay them a salary rather than perpetually being stuck in a coding for free dilema due to everyone having an unlimited use license of their existing code and only being able to provide small modifications of limited value to a professional corporation.

Github has offered free private repositories since 2019 so will use the software and write a few reviews and willing to contribute to open source projects if I am paid for my time. Other than that, I will review and comment and place some small samples online but likely nothing major. Possibly just my implementation of popular tutorials.

I might also post school work where the university allows to post their curriculum publicly but keep in mind they charge tuition for that curriculum so not making any promises just a suggestion at this point.
